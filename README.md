**Return:**

**Return:**

- `message` | `{object}` - A message object with the keys:
  - `message` | `{string}` - Returns a message based on success/ failure with context.
  - `isSuccessful` | `{bool}` - Was the operation successful
    **Description**

The `.buy` action allows you to purchase either a producer or seller of products. You must have the required amount of goods (money) to purchase them. If you supply a quantity, you must have the entire amount needed, no partial purchases.

### `.sell`

```JavaScript
farm.sell(product, quantity)
```

**Params:**

- `product` | `{string}` - Name of Product you wish to sell.
- `quantity` | `{number?}` - Quantity you wish to sell. Optional field, defaults to 1.

**Return:**

- `message` | `{object}` - A message object with the keys:
  - `message` | `{string}` - Returns a message based on success/ failure with context.
  - `isSuccessful` | `{bool}` - Was the operation successful

**Description**

The `.sell` action allows you to sell a product to earn money. You can supply a quantity if you wish to sell in bulk.

### `.total`

```JavaScript
farm.total()
```

**Return:**

- `farmInfo` | `{object}` - Object of the farm information at the time of call. Includes the following keys:
  - `farmProducers` | `{object}` - Object of farm producers, with each producer as a key and their quantity as a number value.
  - `farmProducts` | `{object}` - Object of farm products, with each product as a key and their quantity as a number value.
  - `farmSellers` | `{object}` - Object of farm sellers, with each seller as a key and their quantity as a number value.
  - `farmBank` | `{number}` - Total value value (available to spend), the bank stores a single \$1 as `100`, divide the farmBank value by 100 for dollar value.

Example return:

```javascript
{
  farmProducers: {
    chicken: 10,
    cow: 2
  },
  farmProducts: {
    egg: 21,
    milk: 1
  }
  farmSellers: {
    for_sale_sign: 1
  },
  farmBank: 11000
}
```

**Description**

The total method returns the farms status. This includes the farm bank and all the sub shops such as producers, products and sellers. This total value can be used to update/sync your record of the farm totals upon action.

The output of `.total` is the same data returned in the `handleTick` callback function.

### `.save`

```JavaScript
farm.save()
```

**Return:**

- `saveToken` | `{string}` - a base64 encoded save token.

**Description**

The `.save` method returns a serialised string that represents your farm, its quantities and value. Used to load your farm contents in the future.

### `.load`

```JavaScript
farm.buy(saveToken)
```

## Interfaces

You can customise the products, producers and sellers within the farm library. In order to do so, you will need to conform to the following types and interfaces:

### Producers

```JavaScript
[
  {
    name: 'bakery',
    cost: 1000,
    multipler: 1.05,
    produces: {
      name: 'cookie`
      rate: 0.1
    }
  }
]
```

**Keys:**

- `name` | `{string}` - The name of the producer.
- `cost` | `{number}` - The cost of the producer without decimal places. $1 is stored as `100`, in this example the bakery would cost $10.
- `multiplier` | `{number}` - The compound cost multiplier of the producer, as you buy more of the producer the cost exponentially increases. Set to `1` for no increase.
- `produces` | `{object}` - Object of Produce:
  - `name` | `{string}` - The product name it produces, this must match exactly to an associated product's name.
  - `rate` | `{number}` - The amount it produces per tick. This number can be a decimal. 0.1 would mean it adds 0.1 cookies to the inventory per tick.

### Products

```JavaScript
[
  {
    name: 'cookie',
    value: 100
  }
]
```

**Keys:**

- `name` | `{string}` - The name of the product
- `value` | `{number}` - The value of the product without decimal places. $1 is stored as `100`, in this example the cookie's would be $1.

### Sellers

```JavaScript
[
  {
    name: 'stall',
    cost: 1000,
    multipler: 1.05,
    produces: {
      name: 'cookie`
      rate: 1
    }
  }
]
```

**Keys:**

- `name` | `{string}` - The name of the seller.
- `cost` | `{number}` - The cost of the seller without decimal places. $1 is stored as `100`, in this example the store would cost $10.
- `multiplier` | `{number}` - The compound cost multiplier of the seller, as you buy more of the seller the cost exponentially increases. Set to `1` for no increase.
- `produces` | `{object}` - Object of Produce:
  - `name` | `{string}` - The product name it produces, this must match exactly to an associated product's name.
  - `rate` | `{number}` - The amount it sells per tick. This number has to be a whole number (no decimals).
